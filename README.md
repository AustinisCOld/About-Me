# About-Me
Welcome to the About-Me wiki! I'm currently focusing on data protection and investigating the ethical collection of data. I am also surveying to determine the overall need for data and information education within particular age groups in our society. I am mainly interested in how cybersecurity and data science can help people and how we can use them to shorten the gap in understanding within technological fields.
